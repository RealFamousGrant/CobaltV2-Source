# --== CobaltV2 ==--

# BUILD ON X86 AND RELEASE THANKS! (It won't work otherwise.)

As I did use Ice Source and Memehax not all of it was skidded.

And I know I used this but it's wrong, and by using this you agree to not "rewrite" it in anyway and sell this exploit compiled.

Credits to:

Moltres#6585 - Making, and managing this exploit and Adding a Lua Wrapper from Memehax which apparently no skid can figure out how to do.

Cyberhound#5672 - Helping out w/ some code, check the discord if u wanna know what parts Cyberhound did and helped with.
